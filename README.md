# pizzaToppings

Given the pizza images, it's an exercise in which I had to write the full JS code in order to make the website work. 

## Main tasks done:

##### To write JS to manipulate the DOM in order to change images, button styles, etc.
##### To connect buttons with JS functions.
##### To build the shopping cart.
